# Team10-workflow

## Report
Some things that we ran into when we learned how to create a repository:
- We couldn't come up with a creative team name
- Multiple open source licenses (no one is a lawyer in this group)

Some issues that we ran into when we forked a repository and added an upstream remote:
- Thomas: I cloned the wrong repository at first
- Jonathan doesn't know what an upstream remote is, and neither does Thomas.
- Jim learned all of this github stuff already but he designated himself as a 2 on the github literacy scale.

Some issues that we ran into when we created issues in Github's issue tracker
- Jonathan didn't write a description 
- Thomas did not write the file name in the issue like it says in the instructions.
